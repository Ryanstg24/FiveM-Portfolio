# FiveM-Portfolio
P.S. this is not a complete list of things I have done or helped on. I simply threw together some things.


//Slot Machines//
All of the current stuff in this Portfolio that I threw together just now came from Arma Development. For instance the slot machines which of course I did not provide everything, was a huge project that I am not taking all of the credit for. I worked on that with two other people over the course of a week or so to get it to work. 

//Database Management//
Did not put any database stuff in here but Arma was keen on relying on a properly configured database that took a lot of work. Things would break, or simply when we would push an update we wanted to ensure there was a database. Again Arma 3 RP was huge and it relied heavily on an economy and my a$$ would be fried if I upset a thousand people.

//Config files//
Just like any server no matter the game or even in real life setting up config files was a big part of what I did. Even though they may have been borrowed from somewhere for a template, you end up writing the whole thing anyways.

//Textures FiveM + Arma//
Texturing such as Photoshop work was not my strongsuit. But getting these textures on vehicles I was more than capable of. Not even vehicles, but also player models and buildings was good too. Arma was kind of tough for buildings as it required a lot of work and I could never put myself up to it.

Now onto FiveM...

//Scripting//
I haven't really written any FiveM scripts but more or less edited other peoples scripts or fixed stuff. I love putting out fires and especially with that being my REAL job of fixing stuff I tend to like this more honestly. The investigative skills on why something is broken, throwing errors, or simply not launching/crashing is my speciality.

//EUP Stuff//
I don't mind working with clothing & Vehicles and I know people are working on this now on the Development Team but if you need any help I wouldn't mind.

//Vehicles + Scripting//
Throughout my time I had to manage custom vehicles, adding whitelisted vehicles for specific people, donator levels, adding a multitude of scripts whether they were found online or made from someone on the team. Of course making sure they were fully tested and working before a push to the live server. This took a majority of my time and I would spend hours each day.

//Map Markers + MLO's//
Adding MLO's & Map Markers to go with it (Haven't done it in months) was something that I also loved. I feel we could slowly add more MLO's and I would love to take this project on as well.

//Management//
This I am putting at the bottom but I feel it is the most important. During my Arma Development days I was either running a Community or in Management of a Community. This required a lot of Communication, working with the Community getting their input, involving Faction Leads (Department CoC may be a better word for it here). You name it I had to do it and also work with other developers which at times may be harder than you think. Keeping a Community happy, informed, and understanding that things take some time are all things I have dealt with in the past on a small and huge level. I have played here at MidWest since October of 2021 and I want to give back. I work a full time job so I am NOT going to be putting 100 hours into things but my full time job is remote and I do have downtime...(currently working lol). The other thing I wanted to mention was of course Trello Management, Time Management and suggestion management. 

Long story short I want to help no matter how big or small the project is. It would take me a little bit to get into the swing of things again but I feel I am more than capable.
